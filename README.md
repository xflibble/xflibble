- 👋 Hi, I’m @xflibble
- 👀 I’m interested in systems that solve real problems for real people (usually using software).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to bite my tongue :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opinionated tools that will help product development for the masses, ideally focused on joining the product perspective directly to the implementation.
- 📫 How to reach me - xflibble at any major web mail.
